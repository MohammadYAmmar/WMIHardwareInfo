# Unit Testing rules 
After watching one of the courses on YouTube, there are two main rules:
1. Given_When_Then
It is a way to write the name of the test method, for example there is a method in the project that is its name   
 `GetPropertiesForWMIClass `
After apply rule the test method is `GetPropertiesForWMIClass_When_ClassWin32_Processor_Return_name_CPU`
Another example of a method
 `GetPropertyValuesForWMIClass`
The name of test method name is 
`GetPropertyValuesForWMIClass_With_Win32_Processor_name_Return_i7_8550U` 
Because this result is supposed to be obtained, from reading the name of the test function we know the objection of it, the input and the expected result

2. AAA
AAA: Arrange , Act, Assert
Which are the steps to write the test where with Arrange we know the inputs and declare the variables, then in Act we prepare the method to be tested, and finally Assert to check between the expected values for the test to be true and the actual value that returned.
It has been implemented in the project's test methods.
